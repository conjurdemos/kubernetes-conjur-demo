## Development

If you are using this repository for development
purposes, there is some additional functionality that
you may find useful.

- Setting the `LOCAL_AUTHENTICATOR` environment
  variable to `true` will push
  the Conjur K8s authenticator client and Secretless
  Broker from your local Docker registry to the
  remote registry (if used), and will use that image
  rather than the image from DockerHub.

  This can be useful if you are working on changes to the
  [authenticator client](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client) and
  [Secretless Broker](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker).
  - Run `./bin/build` in `conjur-authn-k8s-client` to
    generate a local Docker image `conjur-authn-k8s-client:dev`
  - Run `./bin/build` in `secretless-broker` to
    generate a local Docker image `secretless-broker:latest`
  - Set `LOCAL_AUTHENTICATOR=true`
  - Run the `./start` script in this repo as usual,
    and the demo apps will be deployed with your
    local builds of the authenticator and Secretless.
